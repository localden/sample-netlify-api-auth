# Sample API Authentication Usage in Netlify Builds

This sample shows how to use the [API Authentication](https://ntl.fyi) feature launched through Netlify Labs in your site builds. The sample uses [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) to generate a static site that contains a graph of GitHub contributions queried through the GitHub API, rendered with d3.js. No client-side calls are executed, as the data is populated at build time.
